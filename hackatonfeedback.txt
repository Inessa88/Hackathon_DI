Hello Inesa this is your Hackaton feedback.
I liked your project seems like a good features to decide wath to watch. You had implemented very well the 
javascript concepts viewed in the course using DOM manipulation and adding and deleting events to your elements.
Liked a lot the sound that you added to the page. Nice code and also well implementation of array and objects methods.
In the future you will be able to get information from an API and able to display the options for your movies
directly from it. Also liked the styling of the page but you only need to fix the sizing of your elements to 
use a fixed footer than not block the view of the user. 

COngratulations on your project. Well done.


feel free to reach me if there is another question.
